## About the blog theme

If you like this theme, you can find it [here](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids) and a [live demo](http://renyuanz.github.io/leonids). This is a Jekyll blog theme, if you don't know what Jekyll is, check its [official site](http://jekyllrb.com/). You gonna love it! Otherwise, I'll keep working on this theme and make it better, so any reviews or suggestions are welcome!
